Point cloud
The code below reads and writes a point cloud.

print("Testing IO for point cloud ...")
sample_pcd_data = o3d.data.PCDPointCloud()
pcd = o3d.io.read_point_cloud(sample_pcd_data.path)
print(pcd)
o3d.io.write_point_cloud("copy_of_fragment.pcd", pcd)
Testing IO for point cloud ...
PointCloud with 113662 points.
True
By default, Open3D tries to infer the file type by the filename extension. The following point cloud file types are supported:

Format

Description

xyz

Each line contains [x, y, z], where x, y, z are the 3D coordinates

xyzn

Each line contains [x, y, z, nx, ny, nz], where nx, ny, nz are the normals

xyzrgb

Each line contains [x, y, z, r, g, b], where r, g, b are in floats of range [0, 1]

pts

The first line is an integer representing the number of points. The subsequent lines follow one of these formats: [x, y, z, i, r, g, b], [x, y, z, r, g, b], [x, y, z, i] or [x, y, z], where x, y, z, i are of type double and r, g, b are of type uint8

ply

See Polygon File Format, the ply file can contain both point cloud and mesh data

pcd
